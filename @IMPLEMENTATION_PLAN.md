Cat-Conquest: Roguelike Breakout Module Implementation Plan
PRIORITY 0: Project Setup
[ ] Initialize a new Cocos Creator 3.x project using the TypeScript template.

[ ] Configure the project for WeChat Mini Game platform deployment.

[ ] Establish the standard folder structure: assets/scenes, assets/scripts, assets/prefabs, assets/art.

[ ] Install minigame-api-typings for WeChat API type safety. Â  

[ ] Create a main game scene named GameScene and set it as the default.

PRIORITY 1: Core Gameplay Entities
[ ] Paddle Implementation:

[ ] Create a Paddle prefab with a Sprite component.

[ ] Create a PaddleController.ts script.

[ ] Implement logic in PaddleController.ts to move the paddle left and right based on player touch/mouse input within screen bounds.

[ ] Attach PaddleController.ts to the Paddle prefab.

[ ] Ball Implementation:

[ ] Create a Ball prefab with a Sprite component.

[ ] Add a RigidBody2D component for physics simulation.

[ ] Add a CircleCollider2D component for collision detection.

[ ] Create a Ball.ts script to manage its state and behavior (e.g., initial launch speed).

[ ] Configure a PhysicsMaterial for the ball to ensure it has perfect bounce (restitution = 1) and no friction.

[ ] Brick Implementation:

[ ] Create a base Brick prefab with a Sprite component.

[ ] Add a BoxCollider2D component.

[ ] Create a Brick.ts script to handle health (hit points) and destruction.

[ ] Implement logic in Brick.ts so it destroys itself upon taking enough damage.

PRIORITY 2: Core Game Loop & Physics
[ ] Game Manager:

[ ] Create a GameManager.ts script as a singleton to manage the game state (e.g., playing, game over).

[ ] Implement a level setup function in GameManager.ts to procedurally place bricks on the screen from a predefined layout.

[ ] Physics & Collision:

[ ] Configure Cocos Creator's 2D physics collision matrix to define interactions (Ball <> Paddle, Ball <> Bricks, Ball <> Walls).

[ ] Implement collision handling logic. When the ball hits a brick, the brick should take damage.

[ ] Create "Wall" nodes with colliders around the play area to keep the ball in bounds, except for the bottom "death zone".

[ ] Win/Loss Conditions:

[ ] Implement logic for the ball entering the bottom "death zone", resulting in a life loss or game over state managed by GameManager.ts.

[ ] Implement logic in GameManager.ts to detect when all bricks are cleared, triggering a "level complete" state.

PRIORITY 3: Roguelike Elements - Power-ups
[ ] Power-up System:

[ ] Create a base PowerUp.ts script and several derived classes for specific effects (e.g., MultiBallPowerUp.ts, LaserPaddlePowerUp.ts).

[ ] Implement logic for bricks to have a chance to drop a power-up prefab upon destruction.

[ ] Implement logic for the paddle to "collect" the power-up on collision, activating its effect.

[ ] Relic (Passive Buff) System:

[ ] Create a RelicManager.ts to track active relics for the current run.

[ ] Implement a basic UI to display currently held relics.

[ ] Implement the first relic: "Explosive Bricks" - When a brick is destroyed, it deals damage to adjacent bricks. Modify Brick.ts to check RelicManager.ts for this effect.
