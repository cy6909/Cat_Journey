Cat-Conquest: Roguelike Breakout Module Validation Plan

**PRIORITY 0 FIXES REQUIRED**: ⚠️ BLOCKING ISSUES IDENTIFIED - MUST BE RESOLVED IN COCOS CREATOR IDE

**CRITICAL FINDINGS**: Validation testing revealed these blocking issues that prevent all gameplay functionality:

✅ **Project Type**: Fixed from "3d" to "2d" in project/version.json  
❌ **GameManager Prefab References**: NULL values prevent game object instantiation  
❌ **Sprite Frames**: ALL prefabs have null sprite frames (invisible objects)  
❌ **Power-up References**: Missing prefab links in GameManager component  

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**: These issues MUST be resolved in Cocos Creator IDE before any validation testing can proceed:

[❌] **STEP 1**: Fix GameManager References in GameScene
- Open GameScene.scene in Cocos Creator
- Select GameManager node → Inspector panel  
- Assign: Ball.prefab → ballPrefab, Brick.prefab → brickPrefab, Paddle.prefab → paddlePrefab
- Assign power-up prefabs to corresponding properties

[❌] **STEP 2**: Fix Prefab Visibility (Choose Option A or B)
- **Option A**: Assign Sprite Textures - Add textures to assets/art/, assign to each prefab's Sprite component
- **Option B**: Enable Solid Colors - For each prefab's Sprite component, enable "Color" mode:
  - Ball: White (#FFFFFF)  
  - Brick: Red (#FF0000)
  - Paddle: Blue (#0000FF)  
  - PowerUps: Yellow (#FFFF00) or Green (#00FF00)

[❌] **STEP 3**: Validation Testing
- Run GameScene in Cocos Creator simulator
- ✅ PASS: Objects are visible on screen
- ✅ PASS: No null reference errors in console  
- ✅ PASS: GameManager can instantiate prefabs successfully

**VALIDATION TARGET**: Once these critical fixes are complete, PRIORITY 0 validation will pass, enabling PRIORITY 1 testing.

PRIORITY 0: Project Setup Validation ⚠️ ISSUES FOUND
[✅] validate project setup:

[✅] Check the current cocos project needs to be a 2D or 2.5D top-down perspective project
✅ FIXED: Changed project type from "3d" to "2d" in project/version.json

[⚠️] When running the Cocos project browser, a blank scene is displayed. Please make sure that prefabs and other objects are working properly.
❌ CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND:
- GameManager has null prefab references (brickPrefab, paddlePrefab, ballPrefab)
- All prefabs have null sprite frames (invisible objects)
- Missing power-up prefab references in GameManager
- GameScene will load but game objects won't function or be visible

[✅] Check that a Cocos Creator project exists in the root directory.
✅ PASS: Project structure is correct with assets/, project/, settings/ folders

[⚠️] Open the project in Cocos Creator and confirm it loads without errors.
⚠️ WARNING: Project will load but with missing references warnings

[❌] Run the GameScene in the simulator; it should display a blank screen without crashing.
❌ EXPECTED ISSUES: Game will appear blank due to null sprite frames, GameManager will throw errors when trying to instantiate null prefabs

PRIORITY 1: Core Gameplay Entities Validation
[ ] ✅ validate paddle functionality:

[ ] Place the Paddle prefab in GameScene.

[ ] Run the scene. Verify that the paddle moves left and right with mouse/touch input.

[ ] Verify the paddle is constrained within the screen's horizontal boundaries.

[ ] ✅ validate ball physics:

[ ] Place the Ball prefab in GameScene.

[ ] Launch the ball. Verify it moves and bounces off the walls and paddle according to physics principles.

[ ] ✅ validate brick destruction:

[ ] Place a Brick prefab in the scene.

[ ] Manually position the ball to collide with the brick.

[ ] Verify the brick is destroyed after one hit (for a 1-HP brick).

PRIORITY 2: Core Game Loop Validation
[ ] ✅ validate level loading:

[ ] Run the GameScene. Verify that a grid of bricks is automatically generated and displayed at the start.

[ ] ✅ validate loss condition:

[ ] Let the ball fall past the paddle into the bottom of the screen.

[ ] Verify that the game enters a "Game Over" state or that a life is correctly deducted.

[ ] ✅ validate win condition:

[ ] Destroy all bricks in the level.

[ ] Verify that the game enters a "Level Complete" state.
