Roguelike Breakout Module - Validation Requirements

⚠️ CRITICAL VALIDATION ISSUES IDENTIFIED ⚠️

Based on PRIORITY 0 validation, the following issues prevent the game from functioning:

IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED:

1. **Null Sprite Frames** - All Prefabs Invisible
   ❌ ISSUE: All prefabs have "_spriteFrame": null
   ✅ FIX: Assign sprite frames or enable solid color rendering
   
   Affected Prefabs:
   - assets/prefabs/Paddle.prefab
   - assets/prefabs/Ball.prefab  
   - assets/prefabs/Brick.prefab
   - assets/prefabs/MultiBallPowerUp.prefab
   - assets/prefabs/LaserPaddlePowerUp.prefab
   - assets/prefabs/Laser.prefab

2. **Missing Prefab References in GameManager**
   ❌ ISSUE: GameManager in GameScene has null prefab references
   ✅ FIX: Link the following prefabs in GameScene's GameManager component:
   
   Required References:
   - brickPrefab → assets/prefabs/Brick.prefab
   - paddlePrefab → assets/prefabs/Paddle.prefab
   - ballPrefab → assets/prefabs/Ball.prefab
   - multiBallPowerUpPrefab → assets/prefabs/MultiBallPowerUp.prefab
   - laserPaddlePowerUpPrefab → assets/prefabs/LaserPaddlePowerUp.prefab

3. **Missing Laser Prefab Reference**
   ❌ ISSUE: LaserPaddlePowerUp component has null laserPrefab
   ✅ FIX: Set laserPrefab → assets/prefabs/Laser.prefab

VALIDATION TEST PROCEDURE:

1. Open project in Cocos Creator 3.x
2. Check for missing reference warnings in console
3. Run GameScene in simulator
4. Verify all game objects are visible
5. Test basic functionality: paddle movement, ball physics, brick collision

EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER FIXES:
- Game objects visible as colored rectangles/circles
- Paddle responds to mouse/touch input  
- Ball bounces with physics
- Bricks destroy on collision
- Power-ups drop and can be collected

CURRENT STATUS: 
❌ Game will load but be completely non-functional due to null references
⚠️ Scene loads but throws runtime errors when trying to instantiate null prefabs
