Your job is to implement the 'Roguelike Breakout' module for the 'Cat-Conquest' WeChat Mini Game.

You will use Cocos Creator and TypeScript as the primary development tools. You have full access to the current project directory to create and modify files as needed.

Make a commit after every significant implementation step (e.g., creating a new component, implementing a core feature).

Use the .agent/ directory as a scratchpad for your work. Store long-term plans and notes there if necessary.

Your primary guide will be the @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and the specifications in the specs/ directory. You will work through the plan, one priority at a time, starting from PRIORITY 0. Your first task is to initialize the Cocos Creator project as described in the plan.
