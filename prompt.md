pick the SINGLE highest priority item from @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and implement it using Cocos Creator and TypeScript.
ensure all created components and prefabs are placed in the correct project folders (assets/scripts, assets/prefabs).
ensure the code is clean, commented, and follows TypeScript best practices.
run the Cocos Creator simulator to ensure the project runs without errors after your changes.

update the @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with your progress and commit all changes with git add -A && git commit -m "..."

if there is a discrepancy in the @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and the spec, always update the @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to match the spec.

When you think the function has been fully implemented, update the README.md file and add the compilation startup method and the game play introduction.

Do not perform unit testing. The priority of completing functions is always higher than testing. Please perform system testing after all functions are completed.
